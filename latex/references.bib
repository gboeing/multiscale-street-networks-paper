But the poor, for the most part, do not participate in these asset accumulation policies. The challenge is to expand the asset-based policy structure so that everyone is included.},

	abstract = {According to the city's official Web site, San Francisco has more than 40 individual neighborhoods.  When San Francisco was on the edge of the Western frontier, it was divided into three parts - the military Presidio, a small village called Yerba Buena near the bay shore and a few houses around the Spanish Mission Dolores in what is now the Mission District.  [...] when the cable car was invented, in 1873, Nob Hill became accessible and crowded with fabulous Victorian mansions.  Transit impacts The city came back in a huge way, mostly along the lines of the brand-new Municipal Railway, which started in 1912 with a electric streetcar line out Geary Street to the Richmond District.  Not only are these rail lines the key elements of what is now the Muni Metro subway, but the rails run down the main streets of neighborhoods like the Parkside, the Inner Sunset, the Ingleside and the Outer Sunset, making them small towns in a city.  A controversial redevelopment project in the late '50s led to big changes in the Western Addition as black residents were moved to the Bayview and Hunters Point areas.  Real estate agents started calling part of the Western Addition "Baja Pacific Heights."},
